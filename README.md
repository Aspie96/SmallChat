# SmallChat
SmallChat is a peer to peer UDP-based protocol created by Valentino Giudice initially designed to create a local network chat without needing to be connected to the Internet. Now, it can actually also be used for communicating with hosts outside the network. Despite it was designed for chat, the protocol can also be used in other scenarios.
